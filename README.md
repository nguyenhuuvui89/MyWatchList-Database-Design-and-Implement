# MyWatchList-Database-Design-and-Implement
Project Direction Overview

I would like to develop a web app that can track all the movies and shows when someone watches movies and shows through streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Disney+ or Netflix etc. by web extension. It’s named “MyWatchList”. It is truly a modern problem that people can’t remember all the movies or shows which people have watched on the particularly streaming platforms when people use multiple streaming services. Usually, when people visit one streaming service to watch movies or show. They can only see their movies or shows history within that same platform. It would be beneficial to have an app to combine and view all these histories where, when and what they have watched or have not finished. MyWatchList will store histories of the movies/ shows which they have seen through all streaming services, making it easier for people to search and continue to watch those movies and shows again.
The following is some examples of how people would use the app and how the app become helpful for them. Mike is using several streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney +. He usually searches through all of 3 streaming platform to find good movies or shows to watch in his free time. Sometimes, he watched the movie and skipped it right after if he found another interesting thing, or he watched it but could not finish to watch it in one time. Day by day, the list keeps increasing and it becomes hard to remember what he has and has not finished, and those movies/ shows belong to which streaming platforms. Using a web extension, MyWatchList automatically recorded all movies and shows information. Last week, his coworkers discussed about ‘Man vs. Bee’ movie and they wondered which streaming service is offering this movie, Mike remembered he already watched this movie, but he could not remember where it belongs to, so he opened the app to get information and forward to his coworkers. Using MyWatchList would be much easier to double check when or what platforms he has seen a movie or show.
In fact, I will have to make a lot of programming components in order to make MyWatchList to be commercial. In this project, I will only develop on database which stores names, streaming services etc. of movies and shows. It will record the details of movies and shows like movie released year, when to watch it, finished to watch or not, rating, actor name, director name. 
The reason I am interested in it because I am also a big fan of watching movies and shows on difference streaming services. Firstly, I always look for new and interesting movies or shows to watch but can’t finished it in one time. Secondly, it always takes a lot of time for me to locate the location of which movie or show I have watched. Thirdly, the current streaming services only have ‘Recently views’ option, so it encourages me to make something that can track and retrieve all movies and shows which I have watched.
